<h1 align="center">Functionality</h1>

<p>The application starts off with a selection menu asking what the user would like to do. They can view or add a department, role, or employee. Once the user chooses which they would like to do, they are posed with questions pertaining to what choice they made. For example, when the user chooses an employee, they are asked what the employee's name is, and what role they have.</p>
